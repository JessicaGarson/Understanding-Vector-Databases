# Understanding Vector Search
Vector databases have established themselves as the new semantic search norm, prioritizing the context and meaning of content over the conventional keyword-based approach. This talk explores the traditional "Classic" search, highlights its constraints, and provides an overview of vector databases. This repository contains code examples, demos, and slides from Exploring Vector Search.
