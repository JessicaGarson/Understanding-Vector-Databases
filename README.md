# Understanding Vector Databases
Vector databases have established themselves as the new semantic search norm, prioritizing the context and meaning of content over the conventional keyword-based approach. This talk explores the traditional "Classic" search, highlights its constraints, and provides an overview of vector databases. This repository contains code examples, demos, and slides from Exploring Vector Search.

## Demos and examples
### Books Demo
Code from this demo was adopted from this [repository](https://github.com/justincastilla/book-search) and the article [Navigating an Elastic Vector Database](https://www.elastic.co/search-labs/blog/elastic-vector-database-practical-example).

### RAG example
The code from the RAG example shown is in [this folder](RAG-example).
